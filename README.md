# AI-robot

An Arduino based robot to map and navigate a maze autonomously with simple Artificial Intelligence.

The software in this project is related to the Udemy class "Artificial Intelligence with Arduinos".

The goal is to program a self driving robot using a breadboard, some servo motors, an Arduino Nano chip, Infrared sensors (emitters and detectors) and a few other basic electrical components.
